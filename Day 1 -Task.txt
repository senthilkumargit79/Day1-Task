This blog  explain about in detailed about HTTP1.1 VS HTTP2
===============================================================

HTTP1.1 is HTTP/1.1, which keeps all requests and responses in plain text format  HTTP1 loads a single request for every TCP connection
Multiplexing: HTTP/1.1 loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded, it blocks all the other resources behind it. In contrast



HTTP2  is HTTP2 is much faster and more reliable than HTTP1   HTTP is a network delay sensitive protocol in the sense that if there is less network delay, then the page loads faster
 HTTP/2 is able to use a single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at once so that no one resource blocks any other resource.



What are objects and its internal representation in JavaScript?





Objects are important data types in javascript. Objects are different than primitive datatypes (i.e. number, string, boolean, etc.). Primitive data types contain one value but Objects can hold many values in form of Key: value pair. These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.

Every object has some property associated with some value. These values can be accessed using these properties associated with them
